      Hello! My name is Andrew Michaud. This is my personal website, which I will use to show off my programming skills as well as projects I have worked on.  It is also an opportunity to try web development and web server management, which I've done very little of to this point. This website is entirely my code (based off <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate"> html5-boilerplate</a>&nbsp;), and I am running this website on a personal server. So far it's been a good amount of work to get this website working, but I am pleased with the result so far, and look forward to what I can do with my website in the future.
