    Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of programming projects I've done or contributed to. Some are from classes, some are personal projects. As most were completed for classes, these projects are very unpolished. Please forgive bad code, bad style, or general roughness of the code. I hope to polish these projects eventually, but that may not happen for a while.
    </p>

    <ul id="projects">
      <li> <h3> Picobot </h3>
        I wrote a genetic algorithm for Picobot as my final project in my first CS course.  The program runs the genetic algorithm with the specified parameters and runs the Picobot program in either IDLE, Turtle, or a VPython rendering.
        <h3> Language: Python </h3>

      <li> <h3> Picobot (Java) </h3>
        I rewrote the above project in Java for practice. This version of the project runs more quickly but can only show the results in terminal output and I believe the algorithm doesn't produce Picobot programs as strong as the Python code did.
        <h3> Language: Java </h3>

      <li> <h3> Spampede (Snake Clone) </h3>
        This was another project for a class. It's a clone of the "Snake" game.There are several gamemodes: you can play alone, with a friend, against a computer, or against 3 computers. You can also watch four computer players battle it out or let the computer control your movement for you.The computer players use a BFS algorithm to find the food.

      <li> <h3> Lorenz Equation Visualizer </h3>
        This program approximates and visualizes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system"> Lorenz system </a> in a Java applet.  I don't know how accurate the visualization is, but it displayed well enough for the class project I used it in.

      <li> <h3> C++ Platformer Demo </h3>
        This is a demo of a 2D platformer, written in C++ and using the SDL libraries. I produced the demo for a class but would like to develop a full game from the demo at some point. The demo contains one map with several rooms that the player can move around.
