I'm going to try to turn this into a Blue Apron cooking blog,
for lack of better ideas.

### Kimchi & Barley Miso Ramen

#### Difficulty Preparing
Lots of stuff to do at the same time.
Lots of veggies to prepare,
lots of water to boil.
My stove doesn't boil water well unless I turn the heat up way high,
and my pots and pans are ceramic and tell me I'm not supposed to do that.
So that was annoying.
I didn't cook the eggs properly,
so no eggs.

#### Amount Meal Resembles Pictures
Not great.
I didn't realize how thin the "matchstick cut" pears had to be,
and I'm not sure how well I prepared the kimchi/broth.
Eh.

#### Deliciousness
It tasted alright.
The noodles were a bit mushy (possibly undercooked).
I liked the scallions.
I think I've had them before but never prepared a meal with them.
I liked the pears,
and the broth was fine.

#### Conclusion
Would eat again,
would prefer that someone made for me.
I think I need a lot more practice with a kitchen,
and maybe more patience.
