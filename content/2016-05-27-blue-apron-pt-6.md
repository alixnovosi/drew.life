### Nonsense Part 2
<img src="{static}/media/cooking/junk2.0.jpg" alt="Some more thrown together nonsense food."/>

More making food before ingredients went bad.
Pizza dough with avocados,
onions,
tomato paste,
mozzarella,
and some other kind(s) of cheese I forget.

Also,
I'm going to be on Blue Apron hiatus for a while.
I've had my fill of
making food more complicated than sandwiches for a while.
I may or may not find something else to fill this space with for the meantime.

#### Difficulty Preparing
Fairly easy,
just had to cut a bunch of things.

#### Amount Meal Resembles Pictures
N/A,
looks like a pizza though.

#### Deliciousness
It was alright.
Not amazing.
Avocado didn't really work out.

#### Conclusion
OK for being made up on the spot.
Fairly happy with the turning dough into a pizza shape part.
