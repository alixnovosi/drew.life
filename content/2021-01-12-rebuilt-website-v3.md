This is probably going to be another short post,
but I figure I get one of these per site rebuild.

So,
yeah,
I rebuilt the site again.

We're still all on Pelican here,
so this "rebuild" is mostly the cleanup/simplify/touch-up type.
The big thing is,
of course,
the <a href="/ocgallery.html">Art Gallery</a>,
which I'm immensely proud of.
Took a lot of work to get it looking nice,
and I'm very happy with the result.

It's also an excuse to stuff my fursona everywhere on the site,
and to prepare to just use that as my general representation online,
which is something I've been building towards for weeks while redoing the site.

also with this big push I'm publicly a furry now instead of privately one,
so that's neat.

enjoy the site bye
