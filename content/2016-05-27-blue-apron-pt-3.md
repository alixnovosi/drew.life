#### Difficulty Preparing
Fairly easy.
Only a few veggies to chop.
Most of the difficulty was the timing of cooking the various ingredients.
I finished cooking the noodles before the ground beef/sauce was ready
so I let them set, and they turned into one big blob.
I had to chop them up again before I could mix them properly.
I also didn't have aluminum foil to wrap and roast the garlic called for in the recipe,
so I had to go out and buy that before I could prepare the meal

Roasting the garlic was fun,
though.
It turned out fairly well and was pretty easy.

#### Amount Meal Resembles Pictures
I think it's basically spot-on.
Presentation could use a touch of work,
but whatever.

#### Deliciousness
I've only had one bowl as of this writing.
It was pretty good!
I think I might not have done the sauce right,
because I don't think it really added much flavor to the meal.
Pork was fine,
noodles were fine,
veggies weren't bad.
We'll see how the rest holds up after being refrigerated.
Also, I think I prefer mazemen to ramen.
I've never been a fan of food you have to drink.

#### Conclusion
Not Bad â„¢
