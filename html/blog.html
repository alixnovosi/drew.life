          <h3>08 March 2016 - Rebuilt website!</h3>
          <p>
            I decided to rewrite my website. I was inspired by being forced into frontend development at work, and also by this
            <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2016/03/06/maybe-we-could-tone-down-the-javascript/">post</a>, and also by this
            <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">site</a>. My first goal was to make my site look at least somewhat decent. I
            liked the old design at first, but in retrospect it wasn't very good. I think this is better - you be the judge! The
            blogpost styles kind of look like garbage. I'll look into that later. Maybe I'll use some markdown.
          </p>
          <p>
            My second goal was to base the site on pure HTML5 and CSS3, no JavaScript, no legacy stuff. I didn't have much before,
            just some random stuff from <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> that I wasn't really using.
            I've cleared that out. I also redid my styles from scratch, in SCSS this time, instead of plain CSS. This made writing
            the styles a bit nicer, and let me use Sass to minimize the final main.css. I don't know how much of a difference that
            made in final size and download speed, but it made me happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was fun messing with my site, again. It's mostly just sat here without any changes unless I had to correct
            blatant lies (my 'about' page still called me a student for a while after I graduated), or I wanted to throw random
            text files into the site (they're kind of like easter eggs!). I don't know if this will motivate me to work more on
            the site or not. I'd like to be the kind of person that does regular blog posts, but I don't know if I can motivate
            myself to do that. I do better sending out short thoughts I don't have to spend much time thinking about (see my
            <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewjmichaud">Twitter</a>). We'll see. Thanks for reading!
