          <h3>Triple Pork Mazemen with Roasted Garlic & Pea Tips</h3>

          <h4>Difficulty Preparing</h4>
          <p>
            Fairly easy. Only a few veggies to chop. Most of the difficulty was the timing of cooking the various ingredients. I
            finished cooking the noodles before the ground beef/sauce was ready, so I let them set, and they turned into one big
            blob. I had to chop them up again before I could mix them properly. I also didn't have aluminum foil to wrap and roast
            the garlic called for in the recipe, so I had to go out and buy that before I could prepare the meal
          </p>

          <p>
            Roasting the garlic was fun, though. It turned out fairly well and was pretty easy.

            I think it's basically spot-on. Presentation could use a touch of work, but whatever.
          </p>
          <h4>Deliciousness</h4>
          <p>
            I've only had one bowl as of this writing. It was pretty good! I think I might not have done the sauce right, because
            I don't think it really added much flavor to the meal. Pork was fine, noodles were fine, veggies weren't bad. We'll
            see how the rest holds up after being refrigerated.

            Also, I think I prefer mazemen to ramen. I've never been a fan of food you have to drink.
          </p>
          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>Not Bad &#8482;</p>

          <h3>Hoison & Shittake Burgers With Sweet Potato Spears</h3>
          <img width="800px" src="../img/hoisin+shitttake_burgers.jpg" alt="hoisin shittake burgers">
          <h4>Difficulty Preparing</h4>
          <p>
            Not that difficult. Lots of veggies to prepare, the mushrooms had to be soaked (and later thinly sliced), and my
            ground beef was in the freezer, so it had to be defrosted. That was all pretty easy, though.  </p>
          </p>

          <h4>Amount Meal Resembles Pictures</h4>
          <p>
            I think it came out right. My potato spears were a bit overdone, but I think they were fine.
          </p>

          <h4>Deliciousness</h4>
          <p>
            I've never met a burger I didn't like, so this boded well from the start. The potato spears were alright. I would have
            liked cheese somewhere on the burgers, but they were fine without it. I didn't really taste the mushrooms, though I'm
            sure they added something.
          </p>

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>Would eat again, would make again.</p>

            I'm going to try to turn this into a Blue Apron cooking blog for lack of better ideas.

          <h3>Kimchi & Barley Miso Ramen</h3>
          <img width="800px" src="../img/kimchi+barley_miso_ramen.jpg" alt="kimchi barley miso ramen">
          <h4>Difficulty Preparing</h4>
          <p>
            Lots of stuff to do at the same time. Lots of veggies to prepare, lots of water to boil. My stove doesn't boil water
            well unless I turn the heat up way high, and my pots and pans are ceramic and tell me I'm not supposed to do that. So
            that was annoying. I didn't cook the eggs properly, so no eggs.
          </p>

          <h4>Amount Meal Resembles Pictures</h4>
          <p>
            Not great. I didn't realize how think the "matchstick cut" pears had to be, and I'm not sure how well I prepared the
            kimchi/broth. Eh.
          </p>

          <h4>Deliciousness</h4>
          <p>
            It tasted alright. The noodles were a bit mushy (possibly undercooked). I liked the scallions. I think I've had them
            before but never prepared a meal with them. I liked the pears, and the broth was fine.
          </p>

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            Would eat again, would prefer that someone made for me. I think I need a lot more practice with a kitchen, and maybe
            more patience.

          <h2>08 March 2016 - Rebuilt website!</h2>
          <p>
            I decided to rewrite my website. I was inspired by being forced into frontend development at work, and also by this
            <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2016/03/06/maybe-we-could-tone-down-the-javascript/">post</a>, and also by this
            <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">site</a>. My first goal was to make my site look at least somewhat decent. I
            liked the old design at first, but in retrospect it wasn't very good. I think this is better - you be the judge! The
            blogpost styles kind of look like garbage. I'll look into that later. Maybe I'll use some markdown.
          </p>
          <p>
            My second goal was to base the site on pure HTML5 and CSS3, no JavaScript, no legacy stuff. I didn't have much before,
            just some random stuff from <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> that I wasn't really using.
            I've cleared that out. I also redid my styles from scratch, in SCSS this time, instead of plain CSS. This made writing
            the styles a bit nicer, and let me use Sass to minimize the final main.css. I don't know how much of a difference that
            made in final size and download speed, but it made me happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, it was fun messing with my site, again. It's mostly just sat here without any changes unless I had to correct
            blatant lies (my 'about' page still called me a student for a while after I graduated), or I wanted to throw random
            text files into the site (they're kind of like easter eggs!). I don't know if this will motivate me to work more on
            the site or not. I'd like to be the kind of person that does regular blog posts, but I don't know if I can motivate
            myself to do that. I do better sending out short thoughts I don't have to spend much time thinking about (see my
            <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewjmichaud">Twitter</a>). We'll see. Thanks for reading!
